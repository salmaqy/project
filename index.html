            <h3>What did you build or change this week?</h3>
            <p>
                This week I worked on my GitHub Pages portfolio website. I focused on
                creating or improving the main sections (About, Projects, Skills, Contact)
                and setting up the foundation for my CS Maths & Tools page. I created a clean
                HTML structure for my portfolio homepage and began styling with CSS to ensure
                a professional appearance.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Which achievement are you most proud of?</h3>
            <p>
                I am most proud of creating a well-organised navigation menu that links smoothly
                between all my main sections. The layout looks clean and professional, and I spent
                time ensuring the page is responsive so it works well on both desktop and mobile
                devices. This required me to understand media queries in CSS, which felt like a
                significant achievement.
            </p>
            
            <h3>What did you find most challenging?</h3>
            <p>
                I found it difficult to understand the GitHub Pages workflow at first – learning
                how to push my files to the repository, set up the correct branch, and make my
                site live took several attempts. Additionally, writing about my projects and skills
                in clear, professional English whilst being concise proved challenging, as I wanted
                to showcase my work without writing excessively long descriptions.
            </p>
            
            <h3>What did you learn about web development or computer science?</h3>
            <p>
                I learned about HTML semantic elements (such as &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, and
                &lt;footer&gt;) and how they improve both accessibility and code readability. I also gained
                practical understanding of CSS flexbox for creating responsive layouts, and discovered
                how version control with Git is essential for managing a live website. Understanding
                the client-server model became clearer when I realised how GitHub Pages actually serves
                my HTML files to visitors across the internet.
            </p>
            
            <h3>What is one concrete improvement for next week?</h3>
            <p>
                Next week I want to complete my CS Maths & Tools page by building at least one working
                interactive tool – either a decimal-to-binary converter or a password strength checker.
                This will help me understand JavaScript better and give visitors a practical demonstration
                of applied computer science.
